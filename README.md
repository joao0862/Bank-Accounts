### Description

  My first project on Github, based on the exercise in Chapter 5 of Caelum's workbook, in the Java language. 
The algorithm aims to create bank accounts, composed of two other classes "Date" and "Accounts", 
whose functions are to create the registration dates and the registration itself. 
To improve the code, I implemented the "Transfer" method, to transfer the amounts between accounts.
